THE WALK OF TRUTH ABOUT A LIFE OF A DEVELOPER! 

my walks to galvanize is quite challenging yet aswesome and filled with a lot of challenges. 
daily i struggle at first and im not gonna lie to myself, everything is new to me.
week 1 Oct 23-27 getting used to my developmet environment, installing software, getting to know each other, trying to keep up with the pace, learning and keep learning
manipulating the terminal, watching and reading more articles on my lectures. 

my goal: is to finshed my units from 1-15 10/23- 29/17 
studying deeper on javascript 

what i learned is, review my notes everyday before i go home, and put more 2 hours study at night before sleep. 

break? yes i need it, think and refreshed. why? its important because i keep missing my bus stop for 2 days now meaning im not paying attention on my sorroundings.

lastly, believe and think great! God Bless!
